An altercation ensues, leading to Cassian accidentally killing one officer and murdering the other. At the planet Ferrix, he attempts to hide his involvement by convincing his adopted mother Maarva's droid, B2EMO, and his friend, Brasso, to cover for him. Having a Starpath Unit (a valuable piece of Imperial navigation technology), Cassian asks his friend Bix to connect him with a black market buyer. Bix agrees and contacts the buyer. Meanwhile, Bix's boyfriend, Timm, is suspicious of Andor. To improve his report to the Imperial authorities, Morlana One's chief inspector of security elects to cover up the murders. However, his deputy, the dutiful Syril Karn, is determined to solve the case. He identifies Cassian's ship, traces it to Ferrix and learns that the fugitive is from the planet Kenari.
