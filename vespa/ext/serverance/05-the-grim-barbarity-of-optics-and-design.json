    "description": "Helly is injured by her suicide attempt, but ultimately survives; she returns to work three days later. Mark continues to read Ricken's book, which carries strong anti-establishment sentiments. Outside work, Mark visits a lodge where Devon gives birth; he nearly tells her about his encounters with Petey, but is interrupted by her contractions. When Helly returns, Cobel orders Ms. Casey to watch her closely. Irving once again hallucinates black liquid in the office and decides to visit Burt to calm himself, but Mark tells him to print a second copy of the directions to O&D first; while doing so, Milchick runs a \"266\" on Irving, causing the copier to print out a painting of O&D employees viciously massacring MDR employees. Milchick arrives and claims it was meant as a joke for Cobel. Irving and Dylan confront Burt over the painting, who claims that he lied about the size of O&D because the MDR department is seen as untrustworthy. Meanwhile, Mark sneaks Helly out of MDR and reveals he has been recreating Petey's map. Helly agrees to help Mark with recreating the map after they discover a previously unknown department in which a single employee feeds baby goats. Meanwhile, Dylan and Irving walk Burt back to O&D; Dylan discovers a hidden copy of the massacre painting, but the trio notice that the painting instead depicts MDR employees massacring O&D employees. Burt takes Dylan and Irving to the unlabelled back room and introduces them as \"friends\".",
