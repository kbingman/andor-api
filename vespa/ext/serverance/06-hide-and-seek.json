    "description": "Cobel is shown worshipping a shrine to Kier Eagan in her home. Graner calls to inform her that he has identified Reghabi, a former Lumon employee, as the person responsible for Petey's reintegration. Irving admits to Burt he is not ready to make their relationship romantic. Mark learns Ms. Casey has been sent to the break room for failing to monitor him and Helly; after a reprimand from Cobel, Mark has Irving take MDR to O&D's back room and makes a speech calling for the departments to work together to understand the inner workings of Lumon. However, Milchick finds them and Mark is sent to the break room; after work, Mark is seen with bruised knuckles. Milchick later briefly awakens Dylan's innie inside his outie's home to locate an infographic card Dylan stole from O&D, but Dylan's innie discovers in the process that he has a son. Outside, Devon runs into Gabby, a woman she met at the birthing lodge, but Gabby does not seem to recognize her. Devon later learns Gabby's husband Angelo Arteta is a Lumon-backed state senator who supports legalizing severance. Cobel, as Mrs. Selvig, gets close to Devon and Ricken by acting as their lactation consultant. Mark goes on a date with Alexa, Devon's midwife, to a concert by Petey's daughter's punk-rock band, and sings along to an anti-Lumon protest song. Later, Mark finally answers Petey's phone and is contacted by Reghabi to meet in person at a nearby university. Cobel orders for a keycard-locked door to be installed at the entrance to MDR.",
