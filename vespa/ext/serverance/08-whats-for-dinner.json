    "description": "Irving's outie is shown to be living alone in an apartment, where he spends much of his time painting identical images of a dark corridor. Helly reaches 100% on her data refinement file, thereby meeting MDR's quota for the quarter. Cobel schedules Mark for a final wellness session with Ms. Casey, and appears disappointed when Mark and Ms. Casey fail to remember each other as husband and wife. She then orders Ms. Casey sent back down to the \"testing floor\", whose entrance is shown to be the same corridor in Irving's paintings. While MDR celebrates quota, Cobel is suspended by the board for withholding knowledge of Helly's suicide attempt and her extracurricular activities as \"Mrs. Selvig\". The MDR team prepares for Dylan to remotely awaken them on the outside; Helly kisses Mark before departing. Mark's outie attends Ricken's book-reading party and tells Cobel (as Mrs. Selvig) that he plans to quit Lumon; Cobel, herself feeling betrayed by the company, encourages him to do so. Dylan receives a \"waffle party\" as a reward for meeting quota, in which he dons a Kier Eagan head and sits within a replica of Kier's bedroom in the Perpetuity Wing while ritualistic and seductive dances are performed in front of him. Dylan leaves midway to access the security office and activates the overtime contingency to awaken Mark, Irving, and Helly's innies in the outside world.",
