    "description": "It is revealed that Moe (real name Alan Black) was Taverner's mole, but was found out and murdered by Curly, who then fled with Zeppo, Larry and Hassan. Driving out of London, Zeppo and Larry reveal that they never intended to go through with killing Ahmed, and entertain the idea of releasing him, becoming increasingly concerned with Curly's erratic behaviour and rhetoric. Lamb and his team flee the property before \"The Dogs\" arrive, knowing that since the operation has not gone to plan that Slough House will be blamed. Cartwright is able to rescue Roddy Ho before he can be taken into custody, but Min and Louisa are unable to stop their colleague Struan from being taken from his home by operatives. Taverner calls Standish several times to flip her allegiance, alleging that Lamb was involved with Charles Partner's death, but she remains loyal to him when he comes to extract her. Leaving her house the two are apprehended by James Webb and head of security Nick Duffy, who force them into a car after searching Lamb. En route to Regent's Park, Standish is able to free herself and Lamb after pulling a Glock 17 from her handbag, the weapon having been taken from Moody and placed there by Lamb. Having discovered the fallout of the failed operation, Director General of the Security Service Ingrid Tierney pulls out of a State Department meeting in the US and heads back to the UK, giving Taverner limited time to tie off loose ends. She manipulates Struan into giving false evidence that Lamb was the mastermind behind the false flag operation involving Black, instead of herself.",
