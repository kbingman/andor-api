    "description": "Taverner confronts Judd at his home, revealing that calls he made to his far-right contacts after Hobden visited resulted in the mission being compromised and Black's death. Tierney returns from the US, ordering all loose ends be tied up after Taverner further lies to her about the operation. Curly forces Larry and Hassan to a secluded woodland at gunpoint to carry out the beheading. However, Larry frees Ahmed and attacks Curly with an axe, but flees which enables an injured Curly to recapture Hassan. Larry arrives at a seaport in Harwich, but is shot dead by \"The Dogs\" on the orders of Tierney, who plant a weapon on his corpse to justify the killing. Curly prepares to kill Hassan outside what he believes is a Norman castle, which Ahmed points out is actually a folly. Lamb, Cartwright, Min and Louisa, with assistance from Roddy, are able to track them to the same location. Curly and River engage in a brief shootout, before he is knocked out by Hassan with a rock. \"The Dogs\" arrive, but the group prevent them from killing the detained Curly. With the outcome seemingly a success, Roddy tells River that all traces of Sid's name have been wiped from existence, indicating she may still be alive. Hobden is killed by Duffy. It is revealed that Charles Partner was the former Director General of MI5, and officially committed suicide as he was being blackmailed by a foreign intelligence service. Lamb tells Standish he knew and provided the gun, as Partner was a close friend. A flashback reveals Lamb actually killed him and made it look like a suicide, on the orders of River's grandfather, David Cartwright.",
