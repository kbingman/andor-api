    "description": "Lamb meets with Nikolai Katinsky, an ex-KGB agent and defector. He alleges when stationed in East Berlin he overheard Popov demanding the cicada program remain funded after the fall of the Soviet Union. His description of the man Popov was speaking to, Andrei Chernitsky, matches Bough’s killer. River bribes a taxi driver in Stroud, who reveals he drove Chernitsky to an airfield and flying club in Upshott, but was instructed to lie about it and call a number should people come looking. Ho traces the number, which places the phone in Estonia. Lamb meets with Taverner and discusses Katinsky's story, and convinces her to fund a fake ID and cover package for River, who he then meets and instructs to investigate the airfield, and its owner Duncan Tropper, further. Taverner is dealing with intelligence and now Home Secretary Peter Judd MP regarding a large upcoming anti-capitalist protest in London. Webb reveals his planned meet with Pashkin to Taverner, who reluctantly approves despite the UK's agreement with Moscow to keep intelligence operatives away from Nevsky, a critic of the Russian government. Min and Louisa meet with Pashkin’s security operatives Piotr and Kyril, but the Russians lie to them about where they are staying. Min covertly follows them back to a commercial address at Edgware Road, but is confronted by Piotr, who puts a gun to his head.",
