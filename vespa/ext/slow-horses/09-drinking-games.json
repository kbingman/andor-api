Believing he was targeted also, Lamb investigates Rebecca, the driver, and discovers she has connections to Russia and previously lived in Vladivostok. He confronts her, and she confesses she was paid off. Min wasn't killed by her car, and she was not driving. Judd is delivering a speech in the City of London on the day of the anti-capitalist protest.
